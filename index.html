             <p>I am a first year student in a field that did not particularly delight me until now. I like to escape through literature and its infinite meanderings. I'm passionate about foreign literature, historical novels, classics, but also mangas and comics. I also love computer science, which is a fascinating field, and becoming a developer later on is something I would like to do. </p>

   <h2>I'm a great lover of reading 📚</h2>

   <p> Reading is a universal way to escape, and to "pause" one's daily life when events overtake us. Books have so much richness to convey to us, it brings people together, and educates them.</p>

    <h2>I would like to improve my logic ♞</h2>

     <p>I unfortunately didn't do mathematics in high school, and this is one of my biggest regrets, as I love this subject. So, I'm trying to improve my logic in any way I can, often playing Rubik's cube, and I'm also planning to take up chess soon. </p>

   <h2>I also like series a lot🍿</h2>

    <p>Nevertheless, for the series I'm more severe than for the books. I only watch historical documentaries on subjects I'm passionate about, or Japanese animation series, as well as drama series. Maybe I should open up a bit more to other genres...</p>
